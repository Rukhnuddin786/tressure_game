🏝️ Treasure Island Adventure Game

This is a text-based adventure game built in Python where the player goes on a journey to find a hidden treasure on a mysterious island. The choices you make will determine whether you find the treasure or meet an unfortunate end!

🎮 How It Works
The game starts with an ASCII map, setting the scene of a treasure island adventure.

The player is prompted with a series of choices:

Direction Choice – Choose between "left" or "right".

Island Approach – If the player chooses "left", they can either "wait" for help or "swim" through the water.

Door Selection – If the player waits patiently, they arrive at a mysterious building with three doors: red, yellow, and blue.

Each decision affects the outcome of the game:

Picking the wrong path leads to dangers like fire, beasts, or sharks.

Choosing wisely leads to the treasure room and victory!
